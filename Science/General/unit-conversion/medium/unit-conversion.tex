\begin{enumerate}

\item Jean Ralphio runs at a speed of $2/ m/s$. If there are $1609/ m$ in a mile, then what is his speed measured in miles per hour? How meters does he cover in 3 hours? How many miles does he cover in 4 hours?

\item A rectangularly shaped garden is $3m$ on each side. What is its area in $yards^2$?

\item The area of a television screen is $1.5 m^2$. If the thickness of the television is $0.3m$, what is its area in $cm^2$? What is its volume in $cm^3$?

\item A circular plate has a radius of $7\ in$. If there are $2.54\ cm$ in an inch, What is the area of the circular plate measured in $cm^2$? If the plate has a thickness of $0.4\ cm$ and is roughly shaped like a cylinder, what is it's volume 
in $in^3$?

\item A bottle of coke has an \textbf{energy density} of $6.25\ cal/oz$ If there are $4184\ J$ in one food calorie, and $0.03\ L$ in one oz, what is the energy density in of the bottle of coke measured in $J/L$. How many Joules of energy are there in a 2L bottle of coke?
