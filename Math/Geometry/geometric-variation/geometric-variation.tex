\begin{enumerate}

\item
The volume of a cylinder is tripled. If the height was reduced to one third of the original height, by what factor did the radius change?

\item 
The volume of a sphere was quadrupled. By what factor did the radius change?

\item
The length of a rectangular prism is doubled; the width is quadrupled; the height is reduced by $99\%$. If the original volume was 400 $cm^2$, what is the new volume?

\item 
The volume of a pyramid is given by the formula.  $V=\frac{1}{3}Bh$, where $B$ is the area of the base of the pyramid. For a square pyramid, the side length of a pyramid is reduced by $20\%$ its original size and the height is increased by $50\%$. If the original volume was 520 $cm^2$, what is the the volume of the new pyramid?

\item 
One circle has a diameter that is twice that of a different circle. What is the ratio of the larger circle's area to the smaller circle's area?
