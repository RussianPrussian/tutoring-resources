\begin{enumerate}

\item
A rectangle with a length of 25 $in$ has the same area as a square. If the square's area is 200 $in^2$, then what is the perimeter of the rectangle?

\item 
A circle with a radius of 12 inches has a circumference equal to the perimeter of a right isosceles triangle. What is the area of the triangle?

\item
A right isosceles triangle has an area of 30 $cm^2$. If a square has a side length equal to the hypotenuse's length, what is the area of the square?

\item 
A rectangle with length 20 $cm$ and width 30 $cm$ has a perimeter that is numerically equal to the area of a certain square (measured in $cm^2$). What is the perimeter of the square?

\item 
One circle has a diameter that is twice that of a different circle. What is the ratio of the larger circle's area to the smaller circle's area?
