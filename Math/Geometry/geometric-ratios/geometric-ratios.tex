\begin{enumerate}


\item The ratio between the areas of two squares is 25:16. If the area of the larger one is 200, what is the perimeter of the smaller one?

\item The ratio between the circumferences of two circles is 4:3. What is the ratio between their
areas?

\item The ratio between two sides of a rectangle are 9:4. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 130, what are the sides of this rectangle?

\item
The ratio between two sides of an isosceles triangle is 3:5. if the angle across
from the longest side is $100 \deg$, and the area of the triangle is 40 $cm^{2}$,
what are the side lengths of the triangle?

\item The ratio between the two legs of a right triangle is 3:2. If the perimeter of this
triangle is 200, how long is the hypotenuse?
